# Formr

Sketch plugin that helps to maintain simple layer proportions.  

Simple proportions of shapes in most cases look aesthetically better than random.
For now it supports `1:1`, `2:1`, `4:3` and `16:9` built-in proportions where first number is width and second is height.

You can also use custom proportions by adding `::prop` to the layer/artboard name (where "prop" can be any simple fraction) and than pressing `ctrl+alt+shift+e`. For example, adding `::1/2` to 100×100 layer name gets you 50×100 layer.

*Formr* supports layers, artboards, and multiple selection.  

__Works with Sketch 40+__

## Shortcuts  

1. To even out proportions press `ctrl+alt+e`
2. To use 2:1 proportion press `ctrl+alt+shift+h`
3. To use 4:3 proportion press `ctrl+alt+shift+j`
4. To use 4:3 proportion press `ctrl+alt+shift+k`
5. To use custom proportion via layer name pattern press `ctrl+alt+shift+l`

For other options, as for now, please use plugin menu.
