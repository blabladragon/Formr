# Formr

Sketch plugin that helps to maintain simple layer proportions.  

Simple proportions of shapes in most cases look aesthetically better than random.
For now it supports even (1/1), 2/1, 4/3 and 16/9 proportions.

You can also use custom proportions by adding `::prop` to the layer/artboard name where "prop" can be any simple fraction and than pressing `ctrl+alt+shift+e`. For example, adding `::1/2` lo my 100×100 layer name and calling the plugin gets you 50×100 layer.

*Formr* supports layers, artboards, and multiple selection.  

__Works with Sketch 3.8+__

## Shortcuts  

To even out proportions press `ctrl+alt+e`.
To use custom proportion via layer name press `ctrl+alt+shift+e`.

For other options, as for now, please use plugin menu.
