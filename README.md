# Formr

Sketch plugin that helps to maintain simple layer proportions.  

Simple proportions of shapes in most cases look aesthetically better than random.
For now it supports even (1/1), 2/1, 4/3 and 16/9 proportions. More options coming soon.  

*Formr* supports layers, artboards, and multiple selection.  

## Shortcuts  

To even out proportions press `ctrl+alt+e`. For other options, as for now, please use plugin menu.
